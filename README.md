## Using This

The schedule lines up the projects and the code alongs. To follow this curriculum independantly or with a group of friends, you can complete the projects and code alongs in the order assigned.  And be sure to join us on slack!  To follow this curriculum as part of our bootcamp, just do your homework and show up on time :)

To follow the projects and code alongs, we recommend you fork+clone the repos.  This will allow you to take notes, study sourcecode, and modify samples directly from your editor.

Also read through the [Key Resources](https://elewa-academy.github.io/General-Resources/key-resources/) section of our resources gitbook before moving on with the curriculum.  It will help you get you head in the game, and many important study techniques necessary for this curriculum are explained in that section.

This curriculum does not cover making your code run, it's all about using your code intelligently. the list of general resources will link to external resources for learning syntax (tutorials, examples, documentation), this will be linked to also from projects and code alongs.

## Class Schedule

A schedule for your time with us. Code alongs are listed on the days we will run them, and project start and due dates are listed. You can navigate directly to the project and code alongs from this schedule.  We will also be posting special events or speakers on this schedule.  

Unless noted otherwise class will start at 9, we will answer questions from the day before and complete today's code along.

## Resources

This gitbook is full of everything you should need to know, or at least a link to it.  Your one-stop shop for everything from learning and study tips to interview preparation tips.  But don't worry about reading it all at once, the projects and code alongs will link you to the relevant pages.
